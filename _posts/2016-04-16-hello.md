Clear your calendar - all roads lead to Manila this October, for the second State of the Map Asia conference. 
SotM Asia kicks off on 1st October, and you're invited to take part in two, full days of OpenStreetMap-related 
presentations, technical workshops, learning sessions, software demonstrations, and numerous interaction opportunities 
between contributors, communities, and institutional supporters of OpenStreetMap (OSM) with the rest of Asia, and the  world.

 
SotM Asia will also host the third [VISIONS Asia Resilience Forum](http://resilienceforum.asia/) which aims to bring together representatives 
from ICT communities, private and public sector to discuss experiences and best practices on developing civic apps for community-based disaster 
resilience in the Asian region.

The UP Diliman [Department of Geodetic Engineering](http://dge.upd.edu.ph/dge/) and Training Center for Applied Geodesy and Photogrammetry (DGE & TCAGP) 
is our venue partner, and the centerpoint for all these events.

This is going to be epic!
